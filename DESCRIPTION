Description: DeconmiR is an R package for the cell type deconvolution of 
      heterogeneous tissues representing a mixture of such cell-types based on 
      miRNA expression data obatined from miRNA-seq or microarray. This package 
      can be used for cell type proportion estimation for the whole blood and 
      different solid tissues. This package provides an unified testing interface 
      to rapidly run multiple state-of-the-art deconvolution methods.
